# PowerShell Toolkit for HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR

The PowerShell Toolkit for HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR supports cmdlets, which are wrappers around the native HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage CLI commands and Web Services API (WSAPI).

## Features of PowerShell Toolkit for HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR

The latest PowerShell Toolkit for HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR works with PowerShell 3.0 and later up to PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell Core 6.x, and PowerShell 7.

It can be used in the following two ways:

**With Native HPE Primera or HPE 3PAR storage CLI command**

When you run the cmdlets, the following actions take place:

1. A secure connection to the HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage is established over a secure shell.
2. The native HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage CLI command and parameters are formed based on the PowerShell cmdlet and parameters.
3. The native HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage CLI command are executed.
4. The output of the cmdlets is returned as PowerShell objects. This output can be piped to other PowerShell cmdlets for further processing.

NOTE: PowerShell Core 6.x and PowerShell 7 are supported only for CLI and WSAPI connections. Not supported for PoshSSH Connection.

**With HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage Web Service API (WSAPI 1.6.4 and 1.7)**

When you run the cmdlets, the following actions take place:

1. A secure connection using WSAPI is established as a session key (credential). Unused session keys expire after 15 minutes.
2. The WSAPI and parameters are formed based on the PowerShell cmdlet and parameters.
3. The WSAPI uses the HTTPS protocol to enable programmatic management of HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR storage servers and provides client access to web services at specified HTTPS locations. Clients communicate with the WSAPI server using HTTPS methods and data structures represented with JSON.
4. The output of the cmdlets is returned as PowerShell objects. This output can be piped to other PowerShell cmdlets for search.
